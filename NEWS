      for ConsoleKit and was never passed to logind. logind/ConsoleKit treat
      greeter sessions without this set as user sessions. This causes greeters
      to show the lightdm user able to be logged in with.
    * Set $USER when running the session-setup-script. This is a regression from
      1.7.5.
    * Fix notification of sessions being logged out. This is a regression from

      fixes bugs where some properties wouldn't be updated when they changed in
      accounts service.

      "display-stopped-script" field allows us to run a script right after
      stopping the display server.
    * Allow dm-tool to run outside of a session if it doesn't need to be.
    * Set $MIR_SERVER_NAME to assign a name to launched sessions. Also use a
      "greeter-" prefix for greeter sessions for the benefit of
      unity-system-compositor.

    * Fix setting session in GTK+ greeter

Overview of changes in lightdm 0.9.0

    * Fix invalid XAUTHORITY variable being set for second X server.
    * Fix bug where switching users created X servers without VTs
    * Release a VT when the X server on it stops
    * Greeters are now just standard X sessions that are stored in
      /usr/share/xgreeters.
    * Binaries now installed in /usr/sbin
    * Drop most of the configure options, they aren't necessary
    * Config changes:
      - Major reorginisation of configuration to make it easier to configure and
        understand.  Users should set [SeatDefaults] section with settings for
        all seats, and can override each setting in a per seat configuration.
      - Default seats are now specified using a [Seat:<name>] section.  If no seats
        are specified then one is started.  This can be overridden by setting
        start-default-seat=false in [LightDM].
      - Support setting autologin user to guest account
      - Split the user accounts configuration into /etc/lightdm/users.conf so the
        main config can be private.
      - The default user session is now "default".  Distributions should put a
        symlink to their chosen default or set one in lightdm.conf.
      - XDMCP keys now stored in keys.conf
    * liblightdm API changes:
      - Both libraries are now version 1 and have API and ABI guarantees.
      - Face images are now local paths not URIs
      - liblightdm-gobject now uses lightdm_ prefix instead of ldm_
      - Non-greeter functions are now moved out of the Greeter class
      - connect_to_server() is now called connect_sync and blocks until
        completion.
      - start_session() is now called start_session_sync and blocks until
        completion. The quit signal is removed, and the greeter should quit if
        this method returns TRUE.
      - login() is now called authenticate()
      - Greeters now have hints instead of configuration (greeters should load their
        own configuration from /etc/lightdm if they need it).
      - liblightdm-gobject uses AccountsService if it is available
      - Added regression tests for liblightdm-qt
    * D-Bus API changes:
      - Expose Seats and Sessions on org.freedesktop.DisplayManager
      - Add a CanSwitch property
      - Rename ShowGreeter() to SwitchToGreeter()
    * Greeter changes:
      - Drop "example" from the name of the GTK+ and Qt greeters and make them
        official default greeters.
      - Use GTK3 for GTK+ greeter.
      - Removed the Vala and Python GTK+ greeters, they weren't being well
        maintained.

    * Allow minimum-display-number to be set in lightdm.conf and on the command
      line.
    * Session X authority now written to ~/.Xauthority by default.  It can be
      configured to run from the system location by setting
      user-authority-in-system-dir=true in lightdm.conf.
    * When using system authority the authority can be updated by the user.
    * Written X authority files now checks hostname and display number.
    * Enironment is no longer passed through to X servers and sessions, this is
      no longer required now PAM works correctly.
    * liblightdm API changes:
      - Drop ldm_greeter_get_is_first() - it was added for testing and doesn't
        work well.

      be confused with new sessions.

        may not be secrets.
      - show-prompt signal now has a PromptType field
      - show-message signal now has a MessageType field and takes over
        behaviour of show-error signal

      VT to be used for other displays.

      username.
    * Correctly connect up D-Bus interface for user switching

    * Configuration changes:
      - Use /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf instead of /etc/lightdm.conf
      - The "displays" item is now called "seats".  LightDM will fallback to
